% function [features,weights] = SD(features,labels,Q)
% Estimates the statistical dependency between features and associated class labels using a quantized feature space.
%
%   Inputs:
%           features:       N x F sized matrix of features, where N is the number of samples and F is the number of features        
%           labels:         N x 1 sized vector of class labels corresponding to each sample
%           Q:              the number of quantization levels used for the features (default = 12)
%
%   Outputs:
%           features:       F x 1 sized vector of feature indices in the
%                              descending order of relevance.
%           weights:        F x 1 sized vector of feature relevances (SDs) in the
%                              descending order.
